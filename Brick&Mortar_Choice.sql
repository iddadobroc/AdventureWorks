-- Final recommendation for brick & mortar locations:
-- Lebanon (Oregon) and Baltimore (Maryland) have been selected based on a combination
-- of high online demand and limited or non-existent reseller presence.

-- California was excluded despite high market gap values because target cities are
-- geographically close to existing reseller hubs, which would likely lead to channel
-- conflict and internal competition.

-- Maryland represents an emerging market with no reseller presence, minimizing
-- cannibalization risk. Baltimore, as the top city in terms of online sales within the state,
-- provides the best opportunity to capture unmet demand.

-- Oregon ranks 3rd in online sales and 7th in reseller sales, indicating strong demand
-- with moderate competition. Lebanon stands out as the city with the highest online sales
-- in the state, while the nearest reseller location is approximately one hour away by car,
-- suggesting a clear geographic gap in physical coverage.

-- This dual-location strategy balances expansion into a high-demand market (Oregon)
-- with entry into an underserved market (Maryland), maximizing revenue potential while
-- minimizing conflict with existing reseller channels.
